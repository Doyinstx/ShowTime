## Usage

### Creating an Event with Multi-tier Pricing

```clarity
(contract-call? .showtime create-event 
  "Live Jazz Night" 
  "An evening of smooth jazz with local artists" 
  "Blue Note Cafe" 
  u800000   ;; Early bird price (0.8 STX)
  u1000000  ;; Regular price (1.0 STX)
  u1500000  ;; VIP price (1.5 STX)
  u20       ;; Early bird capacity
  u100      ;; Regular capacity  
  u10       ;; VIP capacity
  u2024365  ;; Event date (block height)
  u2024300) ;; Early bird deadline (block height)
```

### Booking Different Ticket Types

```clarity
;; Book Early Bird ticket (type 1)
(contract-call? .showtime book-ticket u1 u1 u840000)

;; Book Regular ticket (type 2)  
(contract-call? .showtime book-ticket u1 u2 u1050000)

;; Book VIP ticket (type 3)
(contract-call? .showtime book-ticket u1 u3 u1575000)
```

### Checking Tier Availability

```clarity
;; Check if Early Bird tickets are available
(contract-call? .showtime tier-tickets-available u1 u1)

;; Check VIP ticket availability
(contract-call? .showtime tier-tickets-available u1 u3)
```

### Getting Tier Information

```clarity
;; Get price for VIP tickets
(contract-call? .showtime get-tier-price u1 u3)

;; Get sales breakdown by tier
(contract-call? .showtime get-tier-sales u1)
```

## Ticket Type Constants

- `ticket-type-early-bird`: `u1` - Early bird discount tickets
- `ticket-type-regular`: `u2` - Standard priced tickets  
- `ticket-type-vip`: `u3` - Premium priced tickets

## Pricing Logic

The contract enforces the following pricing hierarchy:
```
Early Bird Price < Regular Price < VIP Price
```

This ensures logical pricing progression across tiers.

- `u101`: Event/booking not found
- `u102`: Unauthorized access
- `u103`: Invalid amount
- `u104`: Event at capacity (legacy)
- `u105`: Event not active or early bird expired
- `u106`: Booking already exists
- `u107`: Insufficient payment
- `u108`: Invalid ticket type
- `u109`: Specific tier is full
- `u110`: Invalid string input

## Installation

2. Clone this repository
3. Run `clarinet check` to verify contract syntax

Test scenarios should cover:
